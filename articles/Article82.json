    "abstract": "Astonishing progress is being made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly in machine learning (ML). Novel approaches of deep learning are promising to even boost the idea of AI equipped with capabilities of self-improvement. But what are the wider societal implications of this development and to what extent are classical AI concepts still relevant? This paper discusses these issues including an overview on basic concepts and notions of AI in relation to big data. Particular focus lies on the roles, societal consequences and risks of machine and deep learning. The paper argues that the growing relevance of AI in society bears serious risks of deep automation bias reinforced by insufficient machine learning quality, lacking algorithmic accountability and mutual risks of misinterpretation up to incrementally aggravating conflicts in decision-making between humans and machines. To reduce these risks and avoid the emergence of an intelligentia obscura requires overcoming ideological myths of AI and revitalising a culture of responsible, ethical technology development and usage. This includes the need for a broader discussion about the risks of increasing automation and useful governance approaches to stimulate AI development with respect to individual and societal well-being.
