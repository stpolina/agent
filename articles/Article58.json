    "abstract": "Cybersecurity ventures expect that cyber-attack damage costs will rise to $11.5 billion in 2019 and that a business will fall victim to a cyber-attack every 14 seconds. Notice here that the time frame for such an event is seconds. With petabytes of data generated each day, this is a challenging task for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Protecting sensitive information is a major concern for both businesses and governments. Therefore, the need for a real-time, large-scale and effective IDS is a must. In this work, we present a cloud-based, fault tolerant, scalable and distributed IDS that uses Apache Spark Structured Streaming and its Machine Learning library (MLlib) to detect intrusions in real-time. To demonstrate the efficacy and effectivity of this system, we implement the proposed system within Microsoft Azure Cloud, as it provides both processing power and storage capabilities. A decision tree algorithm is used to predict the nature of incoming data. For this task, the use of the MAWILab dataset as a data source will give better insights about the system capabilities against cyber-attacks. The experimental results showed a 99.95% accuracy and more than 55,175 events per second were processed by the proposed system on a small cluster. View Full-Text",
