    "abstract": "This article looks at the problem of moral singularity in the development of artificial intelligence. We are now on the verge of major breakthroughs in machine technology where autonomous robots that can make their own decisions will become an integral part of our way of life. This article presents a qualitative, comparative approach, which considers the differences between humans and machines, especially in relation to morality, and is grounded in historical and contemporary examples. This argument suggests that it is difficult to apply models of human morality and evolution to machines and that the creation of super-intelligent robots that will be able to make moral decisions could have potentially serious consequences. A runaway moral singularity could result in machines seeking to confront human moral transgressions in a quest to eliminate all forms of evil. This might also culminate in an all-out war in which humanity might be defeated. View Full-Text",
