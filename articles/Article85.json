    "abstract": "Our previous study proposed an automatic fall risk assessment and related risk reduction measures. A nursing system to reduce patient accidents was also developed, therefore reducing the caregiving load of the medical staff in hospitals. However, there are risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) in applications such as assistant mobile robots that use deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we discuss safety applications related to AI in fields where humans and robots coexist, especially when applying deep reinforcement learning to the control of autonomous mobile robots. First, we look at a summary of recent related work on robot safety with AI. Second, we extract the risks linked to the use of autonomous mobile assistant robots based on deep reinforcement learning for patients in a hospital. Third, we systematize the risks of AI and propose sample risk reduction measures. The results suggest that these measures are useful in the fields of clinical and industrial safety. View Full-Text",
