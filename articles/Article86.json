    "abstract": "With the widespread use of wearable sensors, cloud services, social networking services (SNS), etc., there are various applications and systems that record information on users’ daily activities and support recalling these activities. In various situations in everyday life, it is useful to recall and refer to past events by utilizing such information; therefore, there are increasing expectations surrounding a memory recall system that supports users’ activities. In this research, we aim to realize a system that acquires records of users’ experiences, transforms these records as Active Information Resources, autonomously manages the accumulated records based on the record’s metadata, and supports users’ human memory recall. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a basic framework for accumulating records on daily activities and providing information related to past experiences according to the user’s request. We also present evaluation experiments using the implemented system. View Full-Text",
